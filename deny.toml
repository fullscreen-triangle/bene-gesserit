[graph]
# When creating the dependency graph used as the source of truth when checks are
# executed, this field can be used to prune crates from the graph, removing them
# from the view of cargo-deny. This is an extremely heavy hammer, as if a crate
# is pruned from the graph, all of its dependencies will also be pruned unless
# they are connected to another crate in the graph that hasn't been pruned,
# so it should be used with care. The identifiers are [Package ID Specifications]
